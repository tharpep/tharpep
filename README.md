I'm building intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack development. Currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at Mesh Systems while developing AI systems and cloud architectures.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C/C++, TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, SQL  
**Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (ECS, ECR, S3, CloudWatch), Azure, GitHub Actions, Docker, CI/CD  
**AI/ML:** LLM Integration, RAG, Prompt Engineering, Agent Systems, Model Tuning  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** FastAPI, Node.js, RESTful APIs  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, Docker, Linux, VS Code, Cursor

## Featured Projects

### MY-AI: Personal AI Assistant Framework
Python system with modular architecture for agents, RAG, LLM integration, and model tuning. Demonstrates AI engineering practices: retrieval-augmented generation for context-aware responses, unified LLM provider abstraction, model fine-tuning infrastructure, and comprehensive testing. Built with Docker, pytest, and modern Python packaging standards.

Technologies: Python, Docker, Pytest, RAG, LLM Integration, Agent Systems

### ML Model Evaluation Platform
Full-stack FastAPI and Next.js application evaluating ML models and repositories across 12 metrics. Primary contribution: Designed and implemented complete AWS infrastructure from scratch including ECR, ECS/Fargate, S3 static hosting, CloudWatch observability, IAM roles, and zero-touch CI/CD with OIDC authentication. Also implemented 2 complex metrics: performance claims evaluation and reproducibility scoring using GenAI Studio API with retry logic and LLM fallbacks.

Technologies: FastAPI, Next.js, AWS (ECS, ECR, S3, CloudWatch, Systems Manager), GitHub Actions

### Senior Design: GenAI Subsystem
Multi-team capstone project where I own the complete GenAI subsystem (100% responsibility). Building intelligent automation features integrating LLM-based analysis, vector databases, and context retrieval. Demonstrates system design at scale, multi-subsystem integration, and AI/ML engineering in production environments.

Technologies: TypeScript, Python, LLM Integration, Vector Databases, System Design

## Current Focus

- **Production AI Systems:** Building RAG-based architectures with local-first design and intelligent routing
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Designing scalable, cost-optimized deployments on AWS (ECS, Fargate, S3)
- **AI Evaluation & Research:** Developing methodologies for reproducible LLM and RAG system assessment

## Experience

**Software Engineering Intern** at Mesh Systems
May 2025 to Present

- **AI System Prompt Framework:** Co-developed master IDE prompt standardizing AI-assisted coding workflows across engineering teams. Led 2 company-wide training sessions and 17 individual check-ins.
- **Azure ETL Pipeline:** Automated ETL pipeline with Microsoft Fabric and SQL, reducing monthly Azure reporting from 2-3 hours to 5-10 minutes (95% time reduction).
- **Azure DevOps Sprint Scorecard Extension:** Designed and delivered an Azure DevOps extension with real-time sprint dashboards. Converted static HTML prototype into production-ready React/Next.js solution with backend integration. Technologies: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Azure Static Web Apps, Azure DevOps REST API.

**Senior** at Purdue University
Computer Engineering, graduation May 2026
